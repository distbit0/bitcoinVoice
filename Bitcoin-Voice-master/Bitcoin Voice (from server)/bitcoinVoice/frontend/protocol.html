      <h1 id="title">Bitcoin Voice Protocol</h1>
      <p class="paragraph" style="font-size: 25px !important; float: unset;">

        A vote in the Bitcoin Voice protocol is made by creating a transaction that includes a pair of outputs in the following order.
        <br><br>The first of the pair of outputs has an OP_RETURN that contains the name of the issue being voted on (encoded in hexadecimal). The following output contains the amount of coins being staked on that issue.

        <br><br>The transaction output index number (often called "vout" for output vector) is used to determine the order of the outputs. i.e. where this documentation refers to the "first output of the pair of outputs" and "second output of the pair."

        <br><br>The reason a pair of outputs is used as opposed to just one OP_RETURN output is because the underlying bitcoin protocol makes any output that contains an OP_RETURN unspendable. Therefore we use a pair of outputs as described above to separate the coins being voted with into another (spendable) output.

        <br><br>A simple Bitcoin Voice vote transaction looks like this:
        <br><img style="width:80%;" src="/images/BitcoinVoiceVoteTx.png"/>

        <br><br>An example of a Bitcoin Voice vote transaction that is still valid but that contains other outputs looks like this:
        <br><img style="width:80%;" src="/images/BitcoinVoiceVoteTxExtraOutputs.png"/>
        <br><br>The way that the total stake for an issue is calculated and the way that <a target="_blank" href="/">BitcoinVoice.IO</a> calculates the "Total Unspent Output" column for a particular issue is by summing the amounts of the (unspent) stake/value outputs for all transactions with an OP_RETURN output containing the name of the issue.

        <br><br>Note - if the value output is spent (e.g. the owner decides to buy a uniform density spherical cow using that output) that amount will no-longer be counted toward the issue being voted on.
