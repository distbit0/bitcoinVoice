Bitcoin users can create transactions that include custom data in their outputs. A special kind known as "Public labels" are pairs of such outputs, the first of which contains the data, the second of which relates to the spendable amount. In this way a public label is associated with a spendable output. These kinds of public labels can be created using the latest version of Bitcoin Cash Unlimited which contains a "Public label" field on the Send tab.

The bitcoin community can use public labels to facilitate verified voting and a twitter like presentation of votes. Since votes are simple transactions anyone can verify the voting scores by scanning the blockchain public label data. Votes are added by summing the unspent amount associated to a public label. Users can unvote their coins from their public label simply by spending the public label output into a different custom public label or specify none.  

This is a sleek web UI to facilitate easy viewing and programatic analysis of the public labels voting aggregates on both the Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash blockchains.
